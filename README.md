# Housing Data Cleaning Using SQL

This project is all about cleaning a raw dataset obtained directly from primary data sources. This project is developed on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
This project uses advanced SQL queries to transform, manipulate the data-
1. to maintain **Data Integrity, and Data Consistency**
2. to check for **Data Duplicasy**
3. to check for **Mis field values**
4. to check for **Data Accuracy, and Data Validity**
5. to check for **Data Completeness**

Before the actual data cleaning process, the dataset was pre-cleaned to **address Insufficient Data**. And finally, the cleaned dataset was extracted in CSV format for further analysis of the data.
